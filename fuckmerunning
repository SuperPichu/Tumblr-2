QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TO ANSWER AND VOCABULARY WE HAVE TO DEFINE

# 1. WHAT IS A DASHBOARD

# 2. WHAT IS A BLOG

# 3. WHAT IS A USER AND WHAT IS THEIR PROFILE

# 4. WHAT IS AN INSTANCE

# 5. DO INSTANCES NEED ADMINS IN ORDER FOR SOME INSTANCE PRIVACY SETTINGS TO ACTUALLY FUNCTION AND DO YOU REALLY ACTUALLY WANT TO FUCKING DO THAT

### chris's suggestion:
> blogs and dashboards are the same thing with different privacy settings
> a blog is someone's personal dashboard, not personal as in the one they look at but rather the one containing all of their posts
> you can safely sandbox a blog to the point of infinite customization through html, css, javascript, and even python if you're ambitious. so a user can really go ham on their blog

#6. FIRST, HOW BLOGS WORK. THEN, FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT HOME INSTANCE. THEN, FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT ANOTHER INSTANCE TO CHANGE WHO YOU FOLLOW 

# 7. NAMES?
  > thinking of Diver, because the home instance and the dashboard that results from it could be the "stream" that everyone swims in 
  
# 8. IS THIS ACTUALLY FEDERATED??
  > well no bc technically there is only one server attached to the client, you're just giving the appearance that people can go separate themselves from the main stream of content

# 9. HOW MANY BLOGS IS A USER ALLOWED TO HAVE AND IF ONLY ONE IS ALLOWED, HOW ON EARTH IS A USER SUPPOSED TO CURATE THAT ACCORDING TO EACH INSTANCE? IF THEY CAN HAVE MORE THAN ONE, DO THEY HAVE TO MAKE A NEW BLOG FOR EVERY INSTANCE THEY MAKE? HOW DO YOU ASSIGN BLOGS TO INSTANCES?
