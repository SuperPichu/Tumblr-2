QUESTIONS YOU HAVE TO ANSWER AND VOCABULARY WE HAVE TO DEFINE

# 1. WHAT IS A DASHBOARD

# 2. WHAT IS A BLOG

# 3. WHAT IS A USER AND WHAT IS THEIR PROFILE

# 4. WHAT IS AN INSTANCE

# 5. DO INSTANCES NEED ADMINS IN ORDER FOR SOME INSTANCE PRIVACY SETTINGS TO ACTUALLY FUNCTION AND DO YOU REALLY ACTUALLY WANT TO FUCKING DO THAT

### chris's suggestion:
> blogs and dashboards are the same thing with different privacy settings
> a blog is someone's personal dashboard, not personal as in the one they look at but rather the one containing all of their posts
> you can safely sandbox a blog to the point of infinite customization through html, css, javascript, and even python if you're ambitious. so a user can really go ham on their blog
