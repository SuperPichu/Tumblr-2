# Tumblr-2

# Federalized Tumblr: One main instance of tumblr in which trending posts will serve as the home instance. Users can create individualized instances of dashboards a la Discord in order to better curate their user experience. 

# Ex. buttfuck69 peruses the Home Instance to look at what's trending and sees that people are talking about Elon Musk's non-official divorce from Grimes. buttfuck69 then goes to his instance "frog gender city" to browse this instance, which is one dashboard comprised of posts from the blogs that his friends from high school post on. he then chooses to create a text post talking about the not-divorce and attaches a humorous jpeg illustrating his feelings about the matter.
