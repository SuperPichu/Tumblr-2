# 0.0 BLAHBLAH DEFINITION
	- Blahblah is a social media application with a focus on blogging that's visually appealing. 
	
# 0.1 BLAHBLAH INTENDED USER EXPERIENCE
	- 
	- 

# 0.2 REGISTRATION AND LOGIN
	- People can see posts individually but can't browse any of the instances without an account. The default URL will direct them to a registration screen. 
	- At the registration screen, users can enter an email address and a password. Once it is confirmed that there isn't another blog associated with 
	- Once signed up, users will be teleported to their new blog and given a short tutorial on how to customize their blog, if they so wish. Users can skip the tutorial and the exit button will be highlighted if they are either done customizing or don't wish to do it at all.
	- After that, the user will be automatically directed to the Home Instance. The "instance" button will then be highlighted so users would be invited to explore other instances.

# 1. DASHBOARD DEFINITION
	- The dashboard is the collection of posts that the user browses as their primary form of ingesting that sweet sweet milk that we call content. A dashboard is basically the user's posts and all of the posts made by the blogs they follow.
    
# 1.2 DASHBOARD HOME BAR
	- At the very top of the dashboard is an icon representing the instances a person is currently in which, if clicked, then teleports the user to a long bar with icons and folders containing all of the instances a user has already joined. The folders can have their own colors so users can visually organize them. If it gets too long, the user can tap and swipe right within this bar to access all the other ones.
   	 - On the second-to-last of the dashboard is the post bar, displaying the buttons that a person can click to format a post to a specific format (text, picture video, code, etc). 
   	 - As a user scrolls down, the site infiniscrolls to keep up with the user's scrolling and provide them with a reverse chronological order to all the posts. 
   	 - In the bottom-right corner is a button that allows the user to instantly teleport to the top of the page again if they wish to do something else. 

# 2. POST DEFINITION
   	 - 

# 2.1 POST BAR
   	 - The post bar is the bar from whence all posts of all kinds flow. 
   	 - There are seven types of posts: text, photo, (quote?), (link?), (chat?) ~~code~~, audio, (no video)
     	   > text: 
	   	>>> a text break in the form of a 'read more' function can hide the content of text posts until the user clicks on the 'read more' button which teleports them to the writer's blog page if the post is quite long and the writer wants to be courteous to the reader's scrolling experience
	> photo: 
        > ???
        > ???
		>>> (link had a relatively important function that allowed people to place thumbnails and descriptions to links in a way that text didn't do well on its own)
        > code
		>>> (chat is maybe the most wholly useless kind of post; the feel of chat can just be replicated by imitating greentext in a text post)
    - photo allows for gif
	> audio
	> video eats bandwidth like crazy. don't do it.

# 2.2 POST FUNCTION
	- A post 
	- Users can interact with posts in all of the following ways
		> Reblogging (I think a good subtle way to encourage users to generate unique content is by labeling a reblog as a "pass," like you're passing a note in class around)
		> 
	

# 3. BLOG DEFINITION
    	- A blog is a dashboard housing the user's posts.
   	- Unlike a dashboard, a blog's appearance can be customized. 
	- 

# 3.1 BLOG FUNCTION
	- 

# 4. INSTANCE DEFINITION
  	  - There is a stream of posts collected from the blogs that a user follows and organized into a dashboard. The blogs that a user follows and the posts organized into a dashboard come together to create an instance. 
   	 - The beta will provide users with a premade folder of little icons to clearly mark which instance is which (ex. a user can give an instance dedicated to gardening a cute flower icon and give an instance dedicated to studying for their compsci degree a little illustrated computer icon)
   	 - At the very top of the dashboard of an instance is a bar with four icons: home, instances, explore, and profile. 
 	   - If clicked, the user is teleported to a page displaying the instances as a long bar with icons and folders containing all of the instances a user has joined. The home instance is fixed at the absolute left of the bar. Users can create folders to click and drag icons into to better organize. The folders can have their own colors so users can visually organize them. If the bar containing these icons and folders gets too long, the user can tap and swipe right within this bar to access all the other ones.

# 4.1 INSTANCE FUNCTION
 	   - 

# 4.2. THE HOME INSTANCE
 	   - All posts are technically public on the back end, but marked with a GUID claiming them to a specific private instance.
  	  - The home instance is the only instance that is marked with a little house icon. 

# 4.3. BROWSING FEDERATED INSTANCES
 	  - 
  	  - 

  	  - Users can habitate as many instances as they'd like and they are allowed to create their own to better curate their user experience. 
  	  - When a user hovers their cursor or first taps on the link to a new instance, a box should roll down and display a user-input description of the instance and a small preview of the content within the instance (2 - 4 trending or recent posts). 
    - Instances have three different levels of privacy, much like discord servers. They can 1) be joined by anyone who clicks on them and requests to join, 2) users can send a request to join the instance, or 3) an instance can only be accessed through a unique invite.
